# Blog CMS

One of two front-ends for a full-stack Blog application. This content management system fetches data from a REST API back-end and allows admin-only access to write, publish and edit posts as well as user comments. Built with React, utilizing React Router, Context API to manage state, and React Bootstrap for simple styling.

Penultimate project in the NodeJS course of the Full Stack JavaScript curriculum @ [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-blog-api).

## Reflection

Having built the other public-facing front-end first, this came together quite fast as much of the components and hooks could be reused. I also chose to use React Bootstrap to quickly style this app with a simple and clean interface.
